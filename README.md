HTML - Project 1
06/18/2022 - Starting Project 1. This project will consist of building a basic recipe website by applying all the basic HTML knowledge we've learned so far. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website will be rather simple and not too aesthetically pleasing, but we will revisit for later projects using CSS
